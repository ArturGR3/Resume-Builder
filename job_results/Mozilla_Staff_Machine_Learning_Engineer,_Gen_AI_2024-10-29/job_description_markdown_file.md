Why Mozilla?

Mozilla Corporation is the non-profit-backed technology company that has shaped the internet for the better over the last 25 years. We make pioneering brands like Firefox, the privacy-minded web browser, and Pocket, a service for keeping up with the best content online. Now, with more than 225 million people around the world using our products each month, we’re shaping the next 25 years of technology and helping to reclaim an internet built for people, not companies. Our work focuses on diverse areas including AI, social media, security and more. And we’re doing this while never losing our focus on our core mission – to make the internet better for people.

The Mozilla Corporation is wholly owned by the non-profit 501(c) Mozilla Foundation. This means we aren’t beholden to any shareholders — only to our mission. Along with thousands of volunteer contributors and collaborators all over the world, Mozillians design, build and distribute open-source software that enables people to enjoy the internet on their terms.

About This Team And Role

The Firefox team is a community of engineers who care deeply about delivering the fastest, friendliest, most usable browser possible. We are responsible for making the things you see in the browser work securely, quickly, and well! We are looking for a Staff Machine Learning Engineer to help us develop and grow new Generative AI driven products and tools. You will play a key role in enabling safe and healthy machine learning and Generative AI driven experiences in Firefox.

What is a Staff Engineer at Mozilla? 

A Staff Engineer is the next level from a Senior Engineer. At Mozilla this role can vary but typically a Staff Engineer is a domain expert who leads others within a single team to tackle multi-month projects. Tasks that may be initially ambiguous or require significant planning and require them to influence or direct the work of several engineers. They sequence deliverables and manage risks in their team's projects, provide feedback on our strategy and goals affecting the team, and turn our strategy into action for their team members. Staff Engineers mentor others by stewarding some responsibilities to more junior and senior engineers so they can take on new ones. They collaborate with management on building team consensus and providing direction. Staff Engineers identify gaps and opportunities for improvement to enable a culture of inclusion and allyship, at all levels of the organization.
